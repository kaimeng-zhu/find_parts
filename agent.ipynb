      "Caviat: The actual repair is less than 15 minutes, but I spent a lot of time playing with it before I figured out it was that easy and fast. You don't need to remove the dishwasher from the counter to do this.

Otherwise the water will all drain on the floor when you remove the pump. Then remove the two screws on the kickplate on the front of the unit below the door. Remove the kickplate/maintainence access cover. The drain pump is on the right about 8 inches in. Using two hands you grasp the drain pump with your right hand and use the left hand to push the retaining clip down. Then the drain pump will rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise and can be removed without pulling the dishwasher out. There is likely to be some water leak out that was traped in the pump housing that you can not reach with the vac. Disconnect the wire. Connect the wire to the new pump, put it in place and 1/4 turn clockwise to install it. Replace the kickplate and you're done.Read lessParts Used:Dishwasher Drain Pump\n",

There is a spring and nylon rope link on both sides of the unit. Probably just one link is broken, but the replacement comes with two, so you can replace both or save one as a spare. Look at the good side and it should be pretty self explanatory how it attaches. I found it easiest to first thread the link around the lower pulley, then attach the link to the spring, then spring to the rear support, then the link to the door.5.

The transport wheels on the back were missing, making it harder to move around without scratching the tile and some of the original hardware was rusted or broken off.  I looked up the parts easily he...Read morere on PartsSelect using their parts breakdown diagrams and was glad to see what I needed was still available.  We had a licensed plumber relocate the hot water line and drain for us to make things a bit easier.A licensed electrician had also moved the power line over to the new location and left a wire sticking out of the bottom of the wall to hardwire the dishwasher in again.  We decided to convert the dishwasher to be able to be plugged into a standard 20amp wall outlet instead.  We had already purchased a kit with a nice long cord and strain-relief snap on plastic fitting that snapped onto the metal incoming power box on the bottom front of the dishwasher.  Using the supplied wire nuts, etc., we connected the wires and ground wire to the proper wires from the dishwasher and ground lug.  We put the dishwasher aside and then went to work on converting the power wire coming out of the bottom of the wall, to a conventional outlet.  I am mentioning all this because in our first attempt we unfortunately put the receptacle a bit high off the floor and the new power cord plug end, stuck out and hit the back of the dishwasher so it would not go all the way in and was sticking out from under the counter top.  I tried using one of those flat adapter cables, but even that still stuck out to far.  So we ended up relocating the outlet box as low as we could on the wall and this allowed the plug to stick out into the opening area at the bottom rear area of the dishwasher so it could now be slid all the way in under the kitchen counter properly.  I hope that bit of trial and error will save you some time if you ever decide to go the pluggable route too.The new installation required the use of the dishwasher side mount brackets, so we had to purchase a replacement set of those, complete with the hardware to screw them down.This project took a bit longer than planned due to the power plug problem, one which we will remember for any other similar appliance relocation projects, as well as the time to get our new parts in that we had to order, but other than that the rest went smoothly and the dishwasher was relocated successfully.Read lessOther Parts Used:ScrewDishwasher Transport WheelCover ScrewRetainerShow moreScrew - 8-18 x 1/2\n",

      "Lower Dishrack Wheel SpecificationsThis OEM gray Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel Assembly is a plastic kit that allows the rack to slide in and out of the dishwasher easily. If it breaks or becomes damaged. sliding will feel difficult. This can happen due to normal wear and tear, and the part should be replaced if this occurs. Check your model number and user manual to make sure this part is correct. It attaches directly to the dishrack. To repair, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dishrack. Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.\n",

      "In this case the dishwasher had already been installed for a few years.  After removing it, we inspected it and saw it needed a bit of TLC.  The transport wheels on the back were missing, making it harder to move around without scratching the tile and some of the original hardware was rusted or broken off.  I looked up the parts easily he...Read morere on PartsSelect using their parts breakdown diagrams and was glad to see what I needed was still available.  We had a licensed plumber relocate the hot water line and drain for us to make things a bit easier.A licensed electrician had also moved the power line over to the new location and left a wire sticking out of the bottom of the wall to hardwire the dishwasher in again.  We decided to convert the dishwasher to be able to be plugged into a standard 20amp wall outlet instead.  We had already purchased a kit with a nice long cord and strain-relief snap on plastic fitting that snapped onto the metal incoming power box on the bottom front of the dishwasher.  Using the supplied wire nuts, etc., we connected the wires and ground wire to the proper wires from the dishwasher and ground lug.  We put the dishwasher aside and then went to work on converting the power wire coming out of the bottom of the wall, to a conventional outlet.  I am mentioning all this because in our first attempt we unfortunately put the receptacle a bit high off the floor and the new power cord plug end, stuck out and hit the back of the dishwasher so it would not go all the way in and was sticking out from under the counter top.  I tried using one of those flat adapter cables, but even that still stuck out to far.  So we ended up relocating the outlet box as low as we could on the wall and this allowed the plug to stick out into the opening area at the bottom rear area of the dishwasher so it could now be slid all the way in under the kitchen counter properly.  I hope that bit of trial and error will save you some time if you ever decide to go the pluggable route too.The new installation required the use of the dishwasher side mount brackets, so we had to purchase a replacement set of those, complete with the hardware to screw them down.This project took a bit longer than planned due to the power plug problem, one which we will remember for any other similar appliance relocation projects, as well as the time to get our new parts in that we had to order, but other than that the rest went smoothly and the dishwasher was relocated successfully.Read lessOther Parts Used:ScrewDishwasher Transport WheelCover ScrewRetainerShow moreScrew - 8-18 x 1/2\n",
