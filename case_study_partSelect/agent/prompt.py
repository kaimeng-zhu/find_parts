Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the "action" field are: {tool_names}

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

```

Question: Is PS2358879 compatible with FGHS2631PF4A?
Thought: To asnwer this question, I need to find part PS2358879 for machine FGHS2631PF4A.
