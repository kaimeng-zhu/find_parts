It is a part of the timer assembly. Timer assemblies are located either in the control panel at the top of the dishwasher door, or behind the lower kickplate at the bottom of the unit.\n\nTo get to a timer located in the unit's control panel, first examine the outside of the appliance. Sometimes, depending on the model, you only have to remove a couple of screws in order to remove the outer control panel. In other cases, you will have to remove either the entire internal door panel, or the entire external door panel. In each case, the panel can be removed by removing anywhere from 6 - 10 screws. Be careful to not remove the screws at the very bottom of the door that are actually a part of the hinge assembly. Removing the hinge assembly screws will remove the entire door from the appliance, which is not at all necessary to test the unit's timer. With all of the screws removed, the door panel should be easy to lift off of the door assembly. If you have difficulty lifting the panel, look for other screws you may have missed. There may or may not be a smaller control panel cover. If you do discover one, it will be held in place with either a couple of screws or a couple of clips.\n\nWith the dishwasher's control components fully exposed, you may discover that your model uses two timer motors.

Unplug the unit from the wall outlet, remove the appropriate fuse from the fuse box, or turn off the appropriate circuit breaker in the electrical panel.\nThe water inlet valve on your dishwasher is normally located to the left side behind the lower access panel. Remove the screws that secure the access panel and locate the valve. Inspect the inlet supply connection to the valve for leaks and tighten if required or replace the connector if damaged. Most modern dishwashers use compression style fittings or hoses that can be replaced easily. Remember to turn off the water supply before attempting this repair. Check the body of the valve and the outlet hose for cracks or damage. If there is evidence of a leak in the inlet valve area but it is not present during your inspection, try starting a cycle and observe the valve area while the dishwasher is filling. Use caution when attempting this repair as there will be live voltage in this area and any repair or parts replacement should only be attempted after power has been removed.\n\nIf your dishwasher is leaking because it has overflowed, the water inlet valve may be the cause. A mechanical defect inside of the valve could cause it to stay open even after the float switch has been satisfied. If your dishwasher continues to fill above the heating element, try opening the door latch to see if it stops filling. If it continues to fill, then you have a defective inlet valve that will need to be replaced.", "How to replace a dishwasher's water inlet valve:\nNote:\nDisconnect the power source to your dishwasher before you conduct this or any other repair. Either unplug the unit from the wall outlet, remove the appropriate fuse from the fuse box, or flip the appropriate breaker in the circuit breaker panel.\nLocate your dishwasher's water inlet valve. It should be located behind the lower kickplate panel in either the right or left corner. There will likely be two screws either on the top of the panel, or on its bottom. Remove these two screws, and then remove the kickplate. On some dishwasher models, the door has to be opened in order to gain access to, and remove the kickplate's screws. Close the door before you remove the kickplate panel.\n\nYou will be able to identify the water inlet valve by the hoses that connect to it. There will be one hose feeding water from the house to the water valve, and another hose leading from the water valve that carries water away. Now is a good time to inspect your dishwasher's hoses, to make sure they aren't responsible for any water flow problems. Make sure the hoses are securely connected to the valve. Also check to make sure there are not kinks in the hoses.Turn off your dishwasher's water supply so that you can remove the hose attached to the water valve. The water supply turn-off is located beneath your sink. There will be a knob to turn or a lever to press down on. Alternatively, you can turn off the main water supply to your house at the main valve.\n\nPlace a container below the hose to catch the water that falls out when you disconnect it. The hose that brings water to the valve will most likely screw in place like a garden hose. The hose that carries water away from the valve is probably held in place with a clamp.\n\nThere will be two wires connected to the water inlet valve. If your dishwasher's water inlet valve has two solenoids, then there will be four wires. Label the wires so that you will be able to correctly reconnect them later. The wires are connected using slip-on connectors. Grasp the connectors and pull on them firmly in order to disconnect the wires from the valve's terminals. Do not pull on the wires themselves.

Either unplug the unit from the wall outlet, remove the appropriate fuse from the fuse box, or flick the appropriate breaker in the circuit breaker panel.\nBefore you test the door switch, examine the prong attached to the inside of your dishwasher tub. This prong comes in contact with and activates the door switch when the door is closed. Perhaps the prong on the inside of your dishwasher is missing or damaged, leaving it incapable of activating the door switch.\n\nA door switch is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the dishwasher from operating when the door is open. Dishwasher door switches are only an inch long. Most are black in color and all have metal prongs, called terminals, extending out from the body of the switch.\n\nSome door switches have only two metal prongs extending from the body, while others have three. Those with three terminals will have a common (COM) terminal, a normally closed (N.C.) terminal, and a normally open (N.O.) terminal. Those switches with only two terminals will have either a common terminal and a normally open terminal, or a common terminal and a normally closed terminal. We are providing directions for testing a door switch with three terminals. If you are dealing with a door switch that has only two terminals, ignore the part of this test that does not apply to you.\n\nLocate your dishwasher's door switch. The control panel in the front of the unit may be easily removeable, allowing you access to the switch. In some cases, you will have to first remove the inner panel of the dishwasher door. This is usually accomplished with the removal of a few screws. Be careful to not remove the screws at the bottom of the door that are actually a part of the hinge assembly. Removing these screws will remove the door from the unit, which is unnecessary for this test. With the inner door panel removed, you may or may not discover an even smaller panel covering the back of the control panel at the top of the dishwasher door. This smaller panel is held in place with either a couple of screws, or a couple of clips. The switch you are looking for will be located behind this much smaller panel and it is commonly integrated with the door latch assembly.\n\nUsing caution, remove all wiring harness leads from the switch's terminals. You may need to use needle nose pliers to pull gently not on the wire itself, but on the metallic wire connector. Be aware that some door switches may have a locking clip keeping the harness from coming loose. In this case, there is a protruding lever which must be depressed while the harness is gently pulled away from the terminal.\n\nUse your ohmmeter to test your switch for continuity. Begin by setting your ohmmeter to measure resistance at a scale of Rx1. Touch the metal tips of the test leads together and zero your ohmmeter by adjusting the thumbwheel in the front of the meter until the needle reads '0' on the scale.\n\nTouch one meter lead to the COM terminal and the other lead to the N.O. terminal. Do not push in on the actuator. Your meter should give a reading of infinity, meaning the circuit is open, and there is no continuity. Without moving the meter's leads, press down on the actuator until you hear a 'click'. With the 'click' of the actuator, the meter should produce a resistance reading of zero ohms. This means the circuit is closed and continuity is present.\n\nHint:\nThe presence of a distinct 'clicking' noise is evidence that your switch is working as it should. Be that as it may, switches with only two terminals do not 'click' when actuated.\nKeep the meter lead that is touching the COM terminal in place, but move the other meter lead from the N.O. terminal to the N.C. terminal. You should receive a reading of infinity when you push in on the switch's actuator. When the actuator is released, you should receive a resistance reading of zero ohms.\n\nNow, set your ohmmeter to its highest resistance scale and touch one meter lead to the N.O. terminal and the other meter lead to the N.C. terminal. The resistance reading between these two leads should be infinite.\n\nFinally, take a resistance reading from both the N.C. terminal and the N.O. terminal to any metal mounting hardware that is a part of the switch assembly. You should receive a normal reading of infinity.\n\nAny readings that differ from the ones presented here are indicative of a defective door switch that will need to be replaced.", "How to replace a dishwasher's door switch:\nNote:\nDisconnect the power source to your dishwasher before you conduct this or any other repair. Either unplug the unit from the wall outlet, remove the appropriate fuse from the fuse box, or flick the appropriate breaker in the circuit breaker panel.\nA door switch is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the dishwasher from operating when the door is open.

However, there are some aspects of door switch replacement that are common to all units. They are presented here for your benefit :\n\nWith the power disconnected, begin by removing the inner panel of your dishwasher's door. This is accomplished with the removal of about 6 - 10 screws. Once you have successfully removed the inner panel, locate the switch. There may be another much smaller panel covering the back of the control panel. This smaller panel may be held in place with some additional screws, or with some clips. Dishwasher door switches are only an inch long. Most are black in color and all have metal prongs, called terminals, extending out from the body of the switch. Dishwasher door switches are commonly integrated with the dishwasher's door latch, or mounted to a bracket.\n\nThere will be wires attached to your door switch. Carefully remove them. Be aware that some door switches may have a locking clip keeping the wiring harness from coming loose. In this case, there is a protruding lever which must be depressed while the harness is gently pulled away from the terminal.\n\nUse extra caution in removing switches that are a part of the latch assembly or that have a bracket.
