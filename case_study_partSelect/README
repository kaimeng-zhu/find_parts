Setup:
1. go in agent/config.py to put your openai api key "sk-..." 
    Note: if you can't use gpt4, change OPENAI_MODEL to 3.5-turbo-0125
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. start back end with python backEnd.py
4. open chrome://extensions in your chrome browser, then click load unpacked, and load the extension folder
5. open chrome sidepannel and select Instalily Case Study

Config:
you can change different agent configuration in agent/config.py

Note:
Currently use GPT4. I spend a lot of time prompt engineering gpt3.5, but still can't get consistent accuracy.
Agent is set to verbose so you can see what's going on, should set to false in deployment.
Agent only relies on partselect.com, I didn't use any outside search engine
